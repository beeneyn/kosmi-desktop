# Kosmi Desktop

A feature-rich, unofficial desktop client for [Kosmi](https://kosmi.io), designed to provide a seamless and native application experience on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

This application wraps the Kosmi web app, adding powerful desktop integrations and quality-of-life features that are not available in the browser version.

## Features

 - **Native Experience**: Runs in its own window, separate from your web
   browser.
- **Auto-Updater**: Automatically checks for new versions on startup and
   provides a simple, non-intrusive UI to download and install updates.
   
-   **Tray / Menu Bar Icon**: Hide the app to your system tray. Quickly show
   the window or quit the application from the tray menu.
   
-   **Native Notifications**: Integrates with your OS to display Kosmi's
   notifications natively.
   
-   **Media Key Support**: Use the play/pause keys on your keyboard to
   control media playback, even when the app is in the background.
   
-   **"Always on Top" Mode**: Pin the window to keep it on top of all other
   applications for easy multitasking.
   
-   **Full Navigation Controls**: Includes standard browser controls like
   Back, Forward, Reload, and a "Go to Home" button.
   
-   **External Link Protection**: All non-Kosmi links are automatically
   opened in your default web browser for security and convenience.
   
-   **Polished Startup**: A custom splash screen prevents the jarring "white
   screen" flash when the application starts.
   
-   **macOS Dock Menu**: Quick actions available right from the dock icon on
   macOS.
- **Mute Button**: A mute button for muting video and audio sounds right in the menu
